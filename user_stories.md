User Stories for the Busmall project.

*As a User* I want a simple, straightforward way to be shown various products and choose which ones are most interesting to me.

*As a User* I want an app that clearly displays the pictures of the products 3 at a time, side by side, with a button that says Select under each one.  I also don't want to see the same picture twice in a row.

*As a developer* I want to create a method that cycles through the pictures, displaying three at a time without the same picture shown twice in a row.

*As a developer* I want all images to appear as the same size, positioned side by side.

*As a developer* I want all data stored from the user choices and calculated as a percentage displayed on the main page at the end. I will also show the total number of clicks per product.

*As a developer* I want the user to make a selection 25 times before the total percentage appears on the page.
